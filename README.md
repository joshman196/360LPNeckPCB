# 360LPNeckPCB
A functional clone of the Guitar Hero Les Paul Neck Connector PCB (for the Xbox 360 version). Before you decide to replace your original board, you can try adding solder to its worn pads to see if that will fix your issue of the fret buttons not working properly. This means you won't have to order a new PCB if that ended up being the problem.

**As this is a clone, this PCB is subject to the exact same design flaw as the original, where the pogo pins cause a "divot" on the pads which creates uneven contact, therefore making the connection unstable.** You should only use this if your PCB is beyond broken or missing, or if you want the absolute simplest/cheapest replacement. I have designed alternative neck/body connection PCBs that use pin headers instead of the old pogo pins [here](https://github.com/joshman196/360LesPaulPCB-PinHeaderVariant), which you should maybe consider if you want less problems with your Les Paul neck connection.

**SET PCB THICKNESS TO 1.2MM ON THE PCB ORDER PAGE**. Optionally on JLCPCB, you can set "Remove Order Number" to "Specify a location".
